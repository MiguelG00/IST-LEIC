 * hash tables. Below are time complexities for basic operations

 Operation  |   Time complexity
 Insertion  |   O(1)
 Removal    |   O(1)
 Access     |   O(1)

 The user of this ADT must supply a pointer to a destructor which
 frees all the memory of the inserted element. He/she must also
 supply a pointer to a function which returns a key (pointer to char)
 of the data type.

 There musn't be elements with the same key on ht. It's the user reponsability
 to verify this. If there are repeated elements, find_ht will return one
 element which has the correct key.

 Theoretically different data types could be inserted in this data structure,
 however that is not an inteded use and is not recommended.
